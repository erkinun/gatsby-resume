title: Handling query parameters in Javascript
---
Recently I found out that thereâ€™s a really neat way of dealing with query parameters in Javascript. After getting confused by lots of legacy code trying to string manipulate their way to obtain some simple values from a URL, this simple api really brightened my day so I wanted to share the light with other people ðŸ™‚. 

Say if you go to [https://www.mozilla.org/tr/firefox/95.0/whatsnew/?oldversion=93.0](https://www.mozilla.org/tr/firefox/95.0/whatsnew/?oldversion=93.0) and open DevTools and type the following: 

```jsx
const urlSearchParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)
const params = Object.fromEntries(urlSearchParams.entries())
console.log(params['oldversion'])
```

You will get `"93.0"` in the console as expected. This web api capability has been there for a while in most browsers, like Chrome 49 so feel free to use it in your code whenever you require it. 

The only gotcha Iâ€™d point out that it doesnâ€™t work well with full url strings. Thatâ€™s why in the above example I used `[window.location.search](http://window.location.search)` which gives you the string `"?oldversion=93.0"` . 

Happy coding!
